# Phrase Hunter

"Phrase Hunter" is the name of a browser-based word guessing game. I used JavaScript and Object-Oriented Programming to select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard.

## Style Changes

- Changed the value of 'margin-right' to 5px instead of 2px for HTML elements with the class '.letter'.
- Changed the value of 'width' to 20px instead of 15px for HTML elements with the class '.space'.
